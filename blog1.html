<h1>Blog Post #1</h1>

    As embarrassing as it may sound, I am fairly new to HTML while others
    are pretty familiar to it. <br>Therefore, for my first blog post/learning 
    experience, I wanted to explore CSS. I used these sites <br> to conduct my research about CSS.
    <ul>
        <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/css/">w3Schools</a><br>
        <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS">MDN Web Docs</a> <br>
    </ul>
</p>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is extremely useful because it is what gives<br>
    webpages their interesting looks. Basically, HTML is given very basic styles by the<br> browser;
    these features include:<br>
    <ul>
       <li> links are highlighted<br></li>
       <li>understandable lists and tables<br></li>
       <li>headings are larger than normal text<br></li>

    </ul>
    During the last two labs, we were introduced to CSS and its properties. Examples of our uses<br> with CSS 
    include changing the color of text, creating boxes around code blocks, and adding<br> borders/rounded borders.
    I would say the cool thing about CSS is that its like its own class<br> within an HTML file.
