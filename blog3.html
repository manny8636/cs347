    Continuing our theme of cool CSS properties, today we stumble across 
    will-change. This property <br> alerts the browers which and what changes to
    expect on an element in the near future. These changes <br> are likely part of
    an animation - which makes sense because this property used to be named will-animate. <br>

    Look at these links to see how will-change is implemented:

        <a href= "https://www.w3docs.com/learn-css/will-change.html">W3 Docs</a> <br>
    </ul>

    The will-change property also gives browsers the ability to change an element's 
    scroll position and contents. It is important to note that values must be comma-seperated;
    this property can have the following values:
    <ul>
        unset<br>initial<br>inherit<br>will-change<br>auto<br>scroll-position<br>contents
    </ul>
</p>
