<h1>Blog Post #2</h1>

<p>
    So I have decided to deep dive into CSS by searching on the internet "the most interesting
    CSS properties".<br> On <a href= "https://css-tricks.com/lets-look-50-interesting-css-properties-values/#font-smoothing">CS-Tricks</a>,
    I decided to go with font-smoothing for today's blog. This property controls how <a href= "https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/what-is-anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a><br>
    is applied to the font in question. The CS-Tricks website states:<br>
    <ul>
        "The problem is that after the standard browser anti-aliasing your font may<br> look slightly 
        different from what you see in design software."<br>
    </ul>
    The site continues to talk about how to troubleshoot this problem between Webkit and Firefox. My interest<br>
    lies with anti-aliasing; it is a technique used to eliminate <b>"jaggies"</b> that appear in objects in PC
    games.<br> Jaggies are created when pixels on the screen have to be aligned point to point to create diagnol lines, which
    then<br> reveals their jagged edges.
